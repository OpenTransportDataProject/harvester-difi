The CKAN harvester for data.norge.no

# Project description
The Open Transport Data project is an innovation project for the public sector partially funded by the Research Council of Norway. The project runs from april 2016 to april 2019.

The project aims to establish knowledge, tools, services and methods to help transport authorities in publishing open data accommodating user needs and facilitating utilization. 
One of the expected results from the project is a federated catalogue system for discovery of open data and data characteristics (security issues, quality, type of data, etc.) across different data sources and providers. 

A prototype catalogue system is created based on [CKAN](http://ckan.org/). This repository is a CKAN harvester for harvesting datasets from the open data portal in Norway - [data.norge.no](http://data.norge.no/). 
It is developed in the course TDT4290 at [NTNU](http://www.ntnu.no/) for the Norwegian research organisation [SINTEF](http://www.sintef.no/) and the Norwegian Public Road Administration [SVV](http://www.vegvesen.no/).
